# Green Pilot

An AI-assisted Q&A platform that reuses existing answers to reduce electricity usage and improve sustainability. When a user asks a question, the system checks if an answer exists before generating a new one with AI.

## Goals
- Minimize redundant AI compute
- Encourage community review & editing
- Share answers publicly to reduce future compute costs
